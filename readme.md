# D merge resource

Probably the Index is hkxcmd, but for some reason the index (e.g.
`name=“#0001”`) does not match if you simply convert Skyrim LE's
`Animation.bsa`, so I temporarily put Pandora's template.

## TODOs

- [ ] If we can't dll the template (this will save we the long process of XML
      deserialization), we can make it into json to make it easier to use with
      `simd_json` crate.
